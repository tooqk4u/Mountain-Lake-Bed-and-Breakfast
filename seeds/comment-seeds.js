    comment_text:'he Resort is a lovely place to visit and to relax at. The site is marvelous. Wonderful view of the mountains. My negative is the prices for room service with the 23% Extra changes plus tip is too high. All the chips, water and coke drinks are too high, purchase price just to have a micro wave is crazy as well.',

    comment_text:'I was expecting more from Wyndham. The name and pictures of all the activities are are deceiving. I was expecting more for my family and I got less. Upon arrival we were told to call the front desk to have your room cleaned. They were honest about that. We had to call everyday to have our room "cleaned". The toilet was never cleaned for the week that we were there.',
